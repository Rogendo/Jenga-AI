{"transcript": "Hello 116? Yes, this is a call regarding a child protection matter. I'm worried about my sister's son in Kisumu. He's only seven and he's been forced into child labor at the local market every day since his father passed away. The man who employs him beats him regularly. That's horrific. Has anyone tried to help before? I've spoken to some people, but no one has listened. This sounds like a clear case of physical abuse and forced labor.
