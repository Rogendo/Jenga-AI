Maintenance,"Child Helpline Service, Hello hello, good mornning. Greetings. Greetings. You are speaking to counselor Amina, how can I help you today? Help me. You have called, how can we help you? Welcome. Yes, can you hear me? Yes. How can I help you? This is the child helpline service, you are speaking to Amina. My parent doesn’t... doesn’t take care of me. He doesn’t provide for me. Yes, doesn’t provide how? I only live with my mother. He is there but he has never bought me clothes. Where is your father? Yes, where is your father? He is in town. He works making sofas. Mmh. When you tell your mother to buy you clothes what does she say? She says she has no money. What does your mother do? Yes, what does your mother do? Mother, mmh, what work do you do? I farm. Mother works in farming. Why don’t you know what your mother does for work? Mother, because you asked her, there is someone beside you? Eh. How many are you at home? At home, mmh, we are three. You are the how-many-th born? At home. You are what number among your mother’s children where you live? Home where you live? Mmh Misango. Can you hear me? Did you understand what I asked? Yes. Did you understand what I asked? No. I asked, how many are you in your family. You told me you are three, I asked, what number are you? I am the second born.
And all of you, are you not bought clothes or is it only you? Eh, the other children are bought for, but me, she has never bought me any. When you ask her what does she say? When I ask her, mmh, she says she has no money. Mmh. Where is your mother now? Yes, where is your mother right now? She is here, give her the phone, let me talk to her. Hello, how are you? I’m fine sister. Fine. Eh, I’ve seen this child using your phone. This man has troubled me for a long time, he does not support the child. When the child goes to him, he says, your mother is around. I have struggled with him for a long time until the child has grown. Mmh, has reached this stage where she says this out of pain. It’s painful, I myself am struggling. I go with him to the farm, but he doesn’t want to care for the child. Yes, I had the child with him outside marriage, but he troubles me. He has the ability but he torments the child. Until now, all the clothes the child wears I have bought myself. I have suffered like three years, but the child has grown, and now he demands that mother should go to father to claim our rights. After lacking financially, I am not well off. So every time the child goes there, he’s told we have no money, no money. Even my family knows this. Now the child understands, that’s why he took the phone today after leaving school. I didn’t even know there are such things like complaining or claiming rights for the child. So that’s the situation. The child is not supported, but the others he lives with are taken care of. He knows this himself, but when the child goes there, he says, I have no means, I have no means. Now when will he ever have the means while the child is his? Next year he is joining grade seven. And this child went recently and asked the father to even buy him Christmas clothes, saying I don’t have any, and he refused. I don’t know he also refuses to buy school uniforms or even a two hundred and fifty shilling notebook. Where is the father now? He is in Vwawa, there making sofas. He’s even famous, the one himself. You can ask for his name, he can guide this child, or if possible you can go with him because I seem to have no use. But he has hurt me for long, I’ve been in pain. Which region are you in? Eh, which region are you in? Here in Songwe. Here in Songwe. Songwe, Songwe. Eh, we are in Songwe. Truly, the child called himself. This is the child, I am with him here. Yes. Which district are you from? District? Songwe is the region. We are in Mbozi, Vwawa. Mbozi, Vwawa. Eh, Mbozi Vwawa. We ask you to give us the numbers of the responsible officers, because the numbers they got from school are the ones they used today when he said, Mom, Dad has mistreated me too much. What should I do? Should I call these child desk people maybe they will help? Why doesn’t Dad take care of me? Let him deny it in front of you maybe. Hello. Eh, yes, that’s how it is. We are in Songwe region. What is the name of your village? Isangu. Village of Isangu. Village of Isangu. Isangu. Eh, if you write those names he will be known, because he also lives in Isangu, only we differ by sub-villages maybe. Mmh. Eh, so he is known. And the child will be in grade seven next year, so he’s a child who understands, can express himself, he’ll explain himself. It’s not even necessary to bring evidence because what he’s done to the child is clear. The child’s name? Ali Hassan Mritini. Ali? Ah, the child is called Ali The father is Hassan, and the family name is Mritini. Eh. Robinson is how old? Robinson, this year, I think… How old are you? Eleven, twelve now, next year he’ll finish grade seven. Yes, he can express himself well. He won’t make mistakes. He himself must report the father, not me. He’s reported him himself after being wronged. Okay, I understand. Do you have the father’s number? Eh, the father’s number… honestly, even staying with him is hard, because he’s someone who doesn’t give any help, but we’ll look for the number. You said he’s a sofa maker? Eh, a sofa maker, and he’s known here in Vwawa town. Yes, by the real name Hassan. Eh, called Hassan Mritini. His sister used to live with the Befree Hotel people. So this child is theirs and can express himself. Mmh, if possible, we should come together. Mmh. Eh, don’t think it’s wrong. Eh, don’t worry, I understand, mother. I will… eh, is this your phone? Eh, mine, and the child used it because he said, Mom, why doesn’t Dad care about me? At first he used to go to him, but now he goes and gets nothing. Let him deny it before God, because if he denies before you and before God, he has refused, because this child is his. Mmh, and we have no conflict of love or anything. But the child himself used to go maybe to make peace, saying, Dad, I don’t have this, Mom doesn’t have that. Ah, I don’t have even a 500-shilling notebook. And he refuses to buy. Everything the child uses, I provide. I struggle until now he’s twelve years old. I can’t manage anymore. I go with him to the farm, he says I drag him. Ah. Mmh. I just use my strength and mind to raise this child. But still, after being admitted to school, he said, Mom, why do they say there’s a desk? Which school does he attend? He called you, right? He studies at Isangu Primary School. Isangu Primary School. Eh, okay. Eh, now what I’ll do, I will speak to the social welfare officer, since the relationship involves child welfare. Since the father is around and has the means but refuses, eh, I’ll connect you with the social welfare officer from Mbozi urban area. Not too rural, just in the urban area. You just need to know how to write. I’m explaining that it’s not rural, just normal urban environment. Okay, your district is called Mbozi Rural, eh, though it could be Mbozi Urban. Eh, I know you’re far, that’s why just write it like that. Men like him should stop their foolishness. We women are the ones raising children, right? When I talk to the social welfare officer, I’ll explain and give them your number. Mmh. He’ll call you to his office. I’ll go. Eh, I’ll go with the child if needed, because around this time, six p.m., they’re home, so you can go with the child there. The officer will guide you on what to do, okay? Eh, eh. Okay, once I’ve spoken to the officer, I’ll call you back and give you their name and number. Because this man has started acting foolish. He’s rejecting his child, then who does he expect to raise the child? Even a six hundred shilling notebook he refuses to buy. Eh. Even though we had the child out of wedlock, he shouldn’t mistreat him. No, the child has his right. Ah, okay sister, we’ll deal with this man. Even if I find a child not well cared for, I’ll call this number. Keep it. There are children suffering, some were even burned recently. I’ll reach out to you. Ah, okay, let me find the social welfare officer, then I’ll contact you. Eh, why should I do all this alone while there are people to help? Some children were given numbers at school, they kept them. I didn’t know. I just raise the child, suffering alone. Mmh, but now I know the child has the right to live. If I die, where will he go? Mmh. Eh, now I want us to fix this relationship. Okay, we’ll talk. I’ll call you today after speaking to the welfare officer. Eh, talk to him. Okay mother, all that will be followed up. Even at home, this matter is known, because the child stays with me most of the time, and the local leader, Samson, knows about it. Ah, those maintenance issues he doesn’t recognize because I hide, but I often provide for the child. But most of the time the child is with me, even now I’m home with him, so he knows. Okay, we’ll talk. Let me first find the welfare officer and call you back. Okay, don’t worry. This child is always with me, so it’s well known. He only goes to the father for small things. I’m with him all the time, all these years. We’ve lived together. He’s my child. That’s why he’s hurt, because the father is alive but doesn’t care. Yet all this time, I’ve been the one supporting him. Mmh, okay, let me work on this. Mmh, let me try to reach the welfare officer. Once I find them, I’ll tell them, and they’ll contact you. No problem. The child’s situation is known. Nothing is hidden. When the officer calls you, please cooperate and go to their office when requested to.",Referral,2,Child Maintenance & Custody
Sexual Abuse,"sunday is when I enter at night I don't know how it will be today welcome hello welcome to the child helpline how are you aah fine eeh welcome very much to the child helpline thank you you said what is your name aah my name is Samueli Kiboko Samueli Samueli Kiboko welcome to the child helpline Samueli there is an issue where one child in the environment I live mmh that child was raped mmh when she was raped the report went to the sub-village office mmh the sub-village office had resolved the matter meaning with an explanation of forgiving but later the aunt of that child when she gave me advice when she told me the information I told her the agreement you made is not right eeh that it must go to the village government like there at the sub-village office so that justice is done it should go to the village government mmh so they went to the village office but the suspects After the suspects fled they were two who did the acts of rape to that girl in two different phases at different times so when they fled That mother was given a letter to go to the police she went with the child there she was tested it was seen true the child had already been penetrated she is a child of about six years only like this mmh Mother the child who was penetrated and so she just got treatment but the police gave out an arabizi mmh Now later after later all those suspects returned eeh because as I am explaining to you now it's like six or five months those suspects knew that the problem was over they returned eeh so now the child is living with her aunt, and the aunt is also a widow who has no means, so it has become impossible to take the report to the police so the suspects can be arrested, because the mother doesn’t have the money to afford going back and forth. So after I listened to Radio Maria recently, that’s when I got this number, so I thought to inform you, you who are the ones working in this department. The suspects are here, the girl is here, the medical report was already given, but the mother has just been sitting with it because she doesn’t know how to start the process, she has no money for it, that’s all. And the police station and the courts are far they are far from here to go and return is more than thirty thousand shillings it's very far a normal person cannot and that community of those people who did that were they youth or they are youth they are youth one is a youth of about twenty two years mmh the other is a youth of about twenty eight like this and were they able to sit as a family meaning both families sat and finished it or is it how did it happen until aah aah that first phase is that the mother and that suspect sat under the leadership of the sub-village mmh the sub-village leadership after getting involved that this child has been raped they just saw that this case is big for that young man so they made a resolution out of pity for the young man that what he did could cost him that's when later me that mother came to explain to me boss one two three has happened I said how can you sit in a resolution like that please go to the village office when she went to the village office The village office saw truly what was done at the sub-village was not right those suspects should be arrested By the time the village received that information was making those decisions those people had already gotten the information they fled now and has she been able to try maybe to move forward a bit. Who? meaning has she been able to try in the sense of speaking with the chairmen again anew after these suspects returned? aah aah since the suspects returned she has not spoken with them because the village had already sent the report to the police they gave her a letter to go to the police with it there at the police she was given an arabii so the village doesn't see anymore like it is involved the village knows the matter already went to the police and it was already resolved I just ask for her role now to start with the steps of seeking justice. So they are not involving the village leaders. there it is true for now there eeh if the affected person who is the mother is still, and the child is studying right now ? the child right now is studying she is in standard two I think it is standard two like this . ok what are you called? me my name is Samueli Kiboko I am a resident of here. What is your age aah I am forty-six years old right now. Forty-six years uum and you are from what location where are you? aah we are in singerema district over here lushamba village do you know it? singerema? Eeh meaning singerema district. mmh .if you reach lushamba village tanzamani we are on an island if you reach there you will be on an island. mmh Buchosa constituency. is it mwanza or is it singerema? it is mwanza. Mwanza mwanza mwanza mwanza mwanzaa. Eeh mwanza town you enter Singerema district you come to the villages completely at the very end of Singerema district the very end. I am at the end me. It is called which district? It is called Singerema district buchosa constituency meaning it is famous for buchosa constituency aah okay let me mark here Singerema. eeh buchosa constituency. My phone is on air all the time.mmh. This mother is a person very close to me. Both suspects are present. mmh.And it is just a known issue, the mother has lacked the means to start the steps. And those young men do they live by themselves or do they live with their families? aah, all those young men do not live with their families, they are just youths drifters you know youths who are looking [for work]. Mmh so those young men don't have their own families they are just single in their fishing activities. This behavior needs to be stopped. Aah truly for me when I heard that help can be found through radio Maria, I said better let me give this information for this person and the village government just they have the ability to help meaning if steps begin the village government complained meaning it strongly condemned the act done by the sub-village leaders to sit on a resolution for such a matter. Eeh so the village government is also a witness to this and there is just enough evidence and that girl named those people and that is how it was and they ran away today they have returned so, truly it is an act that is unacceptable. A girl of six seven years, it becomes not right. Okay Singerema is in which region, which district, where which ward? Singerema is the district. Eeh the ward you are in? Buria Heke ward. Buria Heke ward. Buria Heke. Eeh Buria Heke, Soswa village write Soswa. Mmh Soswa . That is the village, if you reach Singerema, if you reach Buria Heke, you will be told where Soswa is , meaning we are right there. And those young men their relatives are not known where they are? Those young men their relatives are present. One , the family is in Kerewe and the other first he lives no his older brother but their home is kigoma. Aah Ok. So we just know them and their families. Aah nearby areas , you are near what area there? An area for what service? Of anything maybe there is a hospital or school. What thing that is public is near. Aah public thing here we have our primary school Soswa it is many years old and we have a dispensary it is already complete it is just remaining to start giving services. Mmh. Which is in Soswa village. The police station, from here to the police station is a bit far. Aah the police station and you said it is far? Eh it is far. You use fare? Eeh it is fare meaning the fare from here to go to the police station, it cannot be less than sixty thousand shillings. Sixty thousand? Thirty thousand. It cannot be less than thirty thousand to get police meaning to go and return meaning it is fifteen thousand fifteen thousand. eeh. to reach the police station to go and return is people and thirty thousand shillings. Will you have information about the child? Her information that? That you identify who she is what she is called? Aah her name? Mmh. No by names they call her like a nickname, but her name no maybe until I talk now with her aunt. Ooh now. eeeh yes. and her aunt you are close you can talk? We are very close, meaning even if it is an internal secret, I will know it. mmh. eeh. What is needed now we do, eeh okay, what is required there is justice and also to stop this type of behavior okay, it should not be repeated again in your village of Soswa. okay. If people have discovered that they did those acts and still again it became a challenge of sitting and they got challenges in the issue of getting justice, it means now there it is just like they are promoting the behavior but. And which is how it is. Just like that it is that, already that girl in the community here I think that we don't know he can continue using the child we don't know. Let's do one thing, me I will try to talk to an officer who is at the ward. okay. then we will see if I will get the one for the ward or I will get the one for the district. okay. after that we will try to talk and I will look for you meaning. okay. then let's talk now we get the mother's details . okay. mother of her child, address, everything that belongs to the mother or if you could mmh if it is not far and you can reach her place time has not gone much, you can go and then you call one one six again you ask for Geoffrey we write her information , of the child then we leave it for the officer to see how he will be able to help. okay. if it is to look for police to try to be able to arrest the culprits. okay. then as she will have the opportunity for the police like just and you try to check and all the items including the arabii, including the hospital documents. all are present. if she has all of them then she should prepare them and give a report at the police station while under the supervision of an officer in that community. okay so me your number I am trying to write your number I will call you again. write I am ready for this. I will call you again then I connect you with that officer if I get him. okay no problem. now there are two things here. eeh. I can call you today or I call you another day. since the suspects and the child is continuing with school well. eeh. and at the hospital they were able to test her also for HIV and other diseases. She was tested for HIV and other infectious diseases she was seen to be safe but it was confirmed that she had already been penetrated. aah ok and did she repeat two times three times to go test? No, this mother has no means to return to the hospital, it is far I have told you our dispensary has not started work, so she went to Karafa hospital. mmh. which is far she did not return a second time but that first time, all the tests showed that. Okay then let's wait. I can call you although it will be late .okay. These are movements that will take a bit of time. no trouble, this matter is six months old, even if it will take a week or another month in being handled it is not a problem. Eeh so me I will try to call you, here I want to look for an officer from there. because today is saturday, I am worried if they will be missing. okay. but monday morning I will start looking for him and me myself I feel monday morning I will look for you also you we see where the feedback is. okay thank you very much. you go and confirm those police documents are present, the hospital ones, after you confirm they are present. I will try to talk to the officer even if you will go out one time, the officer should know your challenge because there are two things, there is a possibility of them being given the law or his relatives to plead. You know because the thing that is there. it already happened a person's child was done to like that but that child needs to be given, we don't know until now what condition she will be in. maybe you see her going to school, she is normal but there is something hurting her in her heart. okay . and it is giving her a hard time . her mother also the parent must be having a hard time due to her child being done wrong to, where she disappeared to. to return again is contempt and the relevant people are failing to do their job. that mother after then I will call you monday morning. okay. and I tell you how to connect you with an officer from there if will get one then so you can be able to fight with that. I know all those costs he can pay , in the event the mother finishes she will just try. mmh. all costs will be paid.aah okay no problem . okay. okay no problem thank you very much.",Counselling,3,VANE
Physical Health,"You are speaking to Juma welcome let me serve you.Haloo. Welcome to the child helpline let me serve you. Eeeh my name is Pendo. Yes Pendo welcome let me serve you.Eeeh me here I had my complaint where I live in my street mmmh there is a girl she has a child of eleven months but this child is in a difficult environment.Mmmh. The mother when she leaves in the morning to return until evening she leaves the child. Mmmm.And where she lives she lives with her grandmother so her grandmother is very old so he is in a difficult environment even that food getting it on time he doesn't get it because the mother is busy so that act for us it hurts us.Mmmh. So I decided to call you so I give you the information. have you already gone perhaps to the street chairman or the ten-cell leader? No I have never gone.I decided to tell you first. It's okay The child's mother what is her name? She is called Salma. And the child what is he called Dailan.The child's father? The child's father I don't know I don't know his name.He is where. He lives in Kasindiuka Isakao.And the child's mother lives where? She lives right here Isakao. So they live Together.Eeeh they live Together.Father and mother just they live Together? Haha she used to live with her husband but they separated.So when they separated she decided to return so she is living with her grandmother.So now she can live with him there meaning she can even sleep outside the child even breastfeeding he doesn't breastfeed so she returns until morning and the morning itself she can return even at eleven o'clock twelve o'clock.And the morning itself she can return even at eleven o'clock twelve o'clock.And at twelve o'clock there even if she returns maybe she bathes if she breastfeeds the child a little when she leaves it's to return until night she might return again so the child is in a difficult environment.Does it mean she leaves the child with someone or the child stays alone?The child she just dumps him leaves him she can even leave him outside maybe his grandmother is the one who if she is sitting inside she has heard a sound maybe the child is crying that's when she can come out someone sees the child sitting outside so that's when she takes him stays inside that grandmother you will find she says says leave it you will go there meaning even you if you come here in the street if you ask everyone will tell you meaning and the grandmother herself is already very old in the sense of staying with the child it becomes impossible.Mmmh. That's how it is. Okay. What are you called. Me I am called Pendo. Pendo who. Pendo Michael. Pendo Michael. Eeeh. What is your age.I am twenty-three years old. And the place you are from what is it called? it is called Katinduka it is in Isakala Morogoro. It is Morogoro? Eeeh. Isakala town?That area is called isakala town. Eeeh Isakala town there is a street that's called Katinduka. And the ward what is it called.It is Katinduka that same one.And then the street is Katinduka A or Katinduka B or Katinduka C. Katinduka A. There nearby where you live where the child lives it is near what thing that is famous maybe a football pitch, market, school.Primary school. Primary school? What is it called? It is called Katinduka school.Now on an issue like this which you find involves a child okay many times it is required we should be able to give this case to the social welfare officer of the relevant area so because of that we we call it a referral.For this referral it will go to the social welfare officer of that area of Isakala if possible so he can look at how he can communicate with that mother of the child or he communicates with you also you look at how you can help this child or they can sit with the mother they can talk with her business parenting or they look at what is it if the child is being subjected to violence to a large extent they can look at how to be able to help him meaning he will have a high probability he will come again to that area he will check on the child also how he is progressing.Okay. I see the child is in a very difficult environment. The child can yaani where he lives there are other small small children so she time to reach home she doesn't have it so those children are the ones to stir porridge they give the child.She parenting with that child she doesn't have it so she has a lot of time to sit with the child raise him meaning her job is just to roam just roam that time to sit with the child she doesn't have it.Does it mean she does what job? She doesn't have any job just roaming in people's houses she doesn't have a job to say even it brings her money if it was like that maybe it would be better but she doesn't have a job yaani she just roams just roams even parenting with the child she doesn't have.And the child's father perhaps maybe you already told him because also he is the one who is supposed to be involved in looking for the child.Aaah the child's father we have never told him because even his numbers I don't have him just we used to hear that he doesn't live here there is another place he lives so they used to live Together then they separated so that girl is the one who returned here so I don't know that man how I can get him.I don't know. Eeeh. Okay I have understood you so it is just an issue of neglecting the child not giving him good care but there is no other violence that she does to him maybe beating the child?Beating she doesn't beat him just on parenting is where the child it becomes she doesn't raise him well, food he doesn't get on time. Okay.Can I get the child's name well you said he is called who. He is called Dailan but the surname I don't know it. You don't know the surname. Eeeh he is called Dailan.Is it nine months? He has eleven months. Is there a place you live with him there and he lives there Morogoro.Eeeh yaani one street. Eeeh. And his mother you said she is called who also. She is called Salma She is called Salma but her surname I don't know it.Salma but if even if they come even to the street here if they ask for Salma they will find her. She has what age?She can be twenty-five twenty-six years. Eeeh. Okay.It will be necessary for me to be able to relate with the Social Welfare of here eeeh so he can work on it if possible he looks at how he can come to help that child because when we are supposed to give this information to the Social Welfare us.Ayaa okay meaning these are officers maraga yaani it would just be if it is possible for example yaani even right now is when they would say let's go we look at the environment perhaps they can reach there they find the child is just there he is just sitting down she the mother is not there the child since morning has not bathed the child yaani I can't even say.Eeeh We are thankful for this information because it will help us it will help us to be able to know and to be able to help the child. This number how were you able to know it?Us here like last month some people came they were educating on matters of social welfare Together with children.So that's when they said if something happens like you see this is harming a child you can call this number 116. Calling is free.Eeeh so that's when I decided to call. Okay we thank you very much. I request to communicate with the Social Welfare so he will look for you I will just request you to be able to give him cooperation so he can you can direct him well just as you have explained to me the issue of the child where he is so that even if he says to communicate with the mother he knows for sure that the mother he is communicating with is found in which place so it can be easy.Okay but even if we communicate even if that person will look for me but I will not want her to know that I am the one who has done this to her.Yeah it is one of the procedures that we do yeah okay. yeah the one who gave the information cannot be known nor should it be known that this is the person who gave us the information related to the case of violence against a child so you will be safe.We will just need you to be able to direct him to the place where she is found and if possible you direct him even to the type of house how it is so it can be easy for him to be able to reach without you meeting him nor getting to know each other more.Ayaa okay. Okay I am very thankful Pendo I when I finish talking with the Social welfare I will look for you when I talk to him any time any day I will tell you.Ayaa. Or he himself will look for you. Ayaa okay. Ayaa thank you. Ayaa good afternoon. ayaa to you too.",Awareness/Information Provided,2,Advice and Counselling
