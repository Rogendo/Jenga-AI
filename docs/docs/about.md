# About Jenga-NLP

Jenga-NLP is a powerful and flexible open-source framework designed to democratize Natural Language Processing (NLP) for African languages. Our mission is to provide researchers, developers, and language enthusiasts with the tools they need to build state-of-the-art NLP models for languages that have been historically underserved in the digital world.

## Our Vision

We believe that language should not be a barrier to accessing and benefiting from the latest advancements in technology. Jenga-NLP aims to bridge the gap by providing a unified framework for fine-tuning and evaluating multi-task NLP models on a wide range of tasks, including:

- Text Classification
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Question Answering
- And more...

## Key Features

- **Multi-Task Learning:** Train a single model on multiple tasks simultaneously, leading to better performance and more efficient use of resources.
- **Config-Driven:** Easily define and manage your experiments using simple and intuitive YAML configuration files.
- **Extensible:** The framework is designed to be easily extended with new tasks, models, and datasets.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Leverage the power of pre-trained transformer models like `distilbert-base-uncased` and adapt them to your specific needs.
- **Experiment Tracking:** Integrated with MLflow and TensorBoard for easy tracking and visualization of your experiment results.
- **Attention Fusion:** An optional attention fusion layer to learn task-specific representations from a shared encoder.
