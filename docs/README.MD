## Content Consolidation Strategy

### Privacy Documentation

**Before:** Three overlapping documents
1. `privacy.md` (900+ lines, very comprehensive but dense)
2. `privacy-policy.md` (template-style, sparse)
3. `data-privacy-security.md` (technical implementation)

**After:** Three distinct, complementary documents
1. **`privacy-policy.md`** - User-facing, clear, accessible (modernized)
2. **`data-privacy-security.md`** - Technical implementation details (unchanged)
3. **`privacy.md`** - Comprehensive DPO reference (to be consolidated)

**Recommendation:** Consider consolidating `privacy.md` content into:
- Policy statements → `privacy-policy.md`
- Technical details → `data-privacy-security.md`
- Compliance frameworks → `data-protection-and-compliance.md`

### API Documentation

**Before:** Four API reference documents with overlap
1. `helpline-service.md` - Detailed but code-focused
2. `helpline-api-endpoints.md` - Comprehensive with examples
3. `ai-service.md` - Basic endpoint listing
4. `ai-service-api-endpoints.md` - Detailed with examples

**After:** Two comprehensive documents
1. **`helpline-api-endpoints.md`** - Complete helpline API reference
2. **`ai-service-api-endpoints.md`** - Complete AI service API reference
